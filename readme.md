Just a smoll collection of trollware (malwares which are made to just troll someone, and to not have any long lasting serious damage). Read further to find out what each program does

<br>

# Program Information

## cantdeleteme.py
<br>

**Required Modules:** None

<br>

**What does it do:** It basically creates a sort of "ghost file", ie a file which will always be there no matter how much you delete it or move it. The program refreshes the file every 5 mins and is automatically set in motion whenever the user boots up their computer. For the base model, the image is a Jerma Sus image ([this](https://imgur.com/a/tYTIUh9)) with the name `When {user} is sus.jpeg`

<br>

**How to reverse the changes:** Either run `cantdeleteme-cure.py` or delete `C:\Users\{User}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\bootup_processes.vbs`

<br>

## epic-rr.py
<br>

**Required Modules:** None (Doesn't even require python once executed)

<br>

**What does it do:** The execution is a lil bit complicated but the end result is basically that when you execute it on a device once, the user will always be rickrolled when they boot up the computer

<br>

**How to reverse the changes:** Either run `epic-rr-cure.py` or delete `C:\Users\{User}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\startup_processes.vbs`

<br>

**NOTE: This works only in Windows**

<br>

## linkspam.py
<br>

**Required Modules:** None

<br>

**What does it do:** It chooses and a random number between 1 and 50 (1 and 50 included) and then, it opens a random link from the following list that number of times:

<br>

## photo-rotater.py
<br>

**Required Modules:** opencv-python. To install it, run the following commands in the command prompt/terminal:

(On Windows)

```
pip install opencv-python
```
(On Mac)
```
pip3 install opencv-python
```
<br>

**What does it do:** It basically rotates all the images in certain paths 90° anti-clockwise. It goes through the images in the following paths:

(On Windows)

`C:\Users\{user}\Desktop`

`C:\Users\{user}\Pictures`

`C:\Users\{user}\Documents`

(On Mac)

`/Users/{user}/Desktop`

`/Users/{user}/Pictures`

`/Users/{user}/Documents`

<br>

**How to reverse the changes:** Either run it 3 more times, or run `photo-rotater-cure.py`

<br>

**NOTE: Please do not stop the execution in the middle, because if you do so, only some images would be rotated and you will have to un-rotate them manually**
